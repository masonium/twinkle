* Absolute priority
+ [X] refactor material so reflectance takes an intersection and returns a specturm (no separate texture-at-point)

* TODO Visible Features
** Shapes
- [ ] box primitive
- [ ] heightmap (based on kd-mesh)
- [X] implicit built-ins
  - [X] torus
  - [X] rounded box
  - [X] capsule


** Materials
- [ ] rough glass material
- [ ] plastic (cook-torrance)

** Textures
- [ ] image-based
- [ ] function-basedd
- [ ] worley-noise

** Renders
- [X] time-based debug renderer (intersection-only)


** Volume rendering !

* External Features
** Lua scripting(!!!)
- [ ] basics (renderer, camera, render-options, sphere, implicit, rough-color material)
- [ ] push luastate into generic renderer

** Internal advancements
- [ ] push scheduler as argument to renderer
- [ ] lua state into
- [ ] Mesh or KDMesh based on number of triangles
- [ ] condensing of nested transforms into transform shapes
- [ ] cache-coherent kd-tree (re)organization
- [ ] population monte-carlo for pixel-choice of dierct lighting

* Scenes
- [X] 'showcase-scene': all available shapes
- [ ] building scene (large tower made of random blocks, two or three large ones primary-colored, smaller in background
- [ ] water-scene (height map with caustics)
